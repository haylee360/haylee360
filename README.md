# Hi, I'm Haylee! 🌿

I am an interdisciplinary environmental scientist interested in applying data science tools to study human-environment interactions. Specifically, I'm interested in environmental justice, community-based conservation, and equitable climate change transitions.

## What I'm up to
I am currently a Global Fellow for the [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) (NCEAS). The Ocean Health Index is a framework for assessing ocean health based on the sustainable provisioning of benefits and services people expect from healthy oceans, such as food, cultural and social value, and jobs.
